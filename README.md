# Drone Finder

**Drone Finder** is a tool designed to locate drones by reading Receiver Antennas' RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values from `wfb-ng`. It displays an On-Screen Display (OSD) in real-time, indicating the proximity of a drone to the receiver based on signal strength.

## Features

- **Real-Time OSD**: Displays an on-screen indication of the drone's proximity based on RSSI values.
- **RSSI Analysis**: Reads RSSI data from receiver antennas to calculate how close a drone is.
- **Dynamic Frequency Updates**: Adjusts beeper frequency to indicate signal strength, making it easier to understand proximity.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into multiple modules for ease of maintenance and extensibility.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ramkrishna757575/openIPC-drone-finder.git
    cd DroneFinder
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. To build a binary run the following command. You can find the binary with name `main` inside `dist` folder.
    ```sh
    pyinstaller --onefile main.py
    ```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```sh
python main.py [--verbose] [--osd]
```
```
--verbose: Enable verbose mode for logging.
--osd: Enable OSD mode for displaying how close the drone is to the receiver.
```

## Components
`main.py`
The entry point of the application. It sets up argument parsing, starts the frequency updater, and initializes the OSD if specified.

`osd_widget.py`
Defines the OSDWidget class, which is a PyQt5 widget for displaying the real-time OSD.

`cairo_renderer.py`
Defines the CairoRenderer class, which uses Cairo to render the signal strength on a surface.

`frequency_updater.py`
Contains functions for fetching and updating the current frequency.
